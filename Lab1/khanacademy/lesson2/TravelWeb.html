<h2> Song about beach life! </h2>
<p class ="song">Golden sun, blue sky, ocean wide,<br>
Warm sand dancing with the tide.<br>
Palm trees sway, worries fly,<br>
In Hawaii, we feel alive.<br></p>

<p class = "song">Morning light on island roads,<br>
Salty air, we drop our loads.<br>
Waves keep time, a gentle beat,<br>
Barefoot steps on burning heat.<br></p>

<p class =  "song">Stars appear, the night feels right,<br>
Ukulele, soft and light,<br>
Hold this moment, don’t say bye,<br>
Hawaii lives inside our sigh.<br></p>
